### Disclaimer
  
Cheating in video games often stems from deeper psychological needs, such as low self-esteem and a desire for control. If you find yourself resorting to cheats, it's worth taking a moment to reflect on why.  

Cheating can provide a temporary sense of control and accomplishment, but it ultimately undermines your genuine self-worth. True satisfaction comes from overcoming challenges and developing skills through honest effort.  

Overcoming cheating habits may require addressing underlying psychological issues. Talking to a therapist or counselor can help you develop healthier coping mechanisms and cultivate a more positive gaming experience.  

This was written with the help of Google Bard. Thank you Bard :)
